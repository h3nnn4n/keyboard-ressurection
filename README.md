Keyboard Resurrection
===========================

What?
-------
My beloved mechanical keyboard died a tragic wet death some years ago. Now I am
resurrecting it. This repo may hold some stuff about how I made it. The firmware
will be developed here.

Why?
-------
Mechanical Keyboards are expensive and I like fixing stuff.
